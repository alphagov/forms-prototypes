      GOV.UK Forms is a new platform that makes it easy to create accessible online forms for the GOV.UK website.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Because it’s still in the early stages of development, the <a class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="features">features available are limited</a>. So it will not be suitable for creating all types of online form.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Create an account to try it out</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      If you’re from a central government organisation you can create an account to try GOV.UK Forms out and start making forms.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Some departments are restricting who can create an account from their organisation. We’ll tell you if this affects you.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      You’ll need to use your government email address to create an account.
    </p>

    {{ govukButton({ 
      text: 'Create an account',
      href: "sign-up",
      isStartButton: true 
    }) }}

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Who can make forms live</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      When you first create an account, you’ll be able to create and preview forms but you will not be able to make forms live.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      You’ll only be able to make forms live if:
    </p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>
        you’re from a central government organisation that publishes content on the GOV.UK website
      </li>
      <li>
      someone from your organisation has agreed to a ‘Memorandum of Understanding’ with GOV.UK Forms
      </li>
      <li>
      you’ve been given permission to make forms live from your organisation’s GOV.UK Forms admin
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      You’ll be able to get help with this process from your organisation’s GOV.UK Forms admin or from the GOV.UK Forms team.
