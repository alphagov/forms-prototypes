        GOV.UK Forms is a new platform that makes it easy to create accessible online forms for the GOV.UK website.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Because it’s still in the early stages of development,
        <a href="#" class="govuk-link">the features available are limited</a>. So it will not be suitable for creating all types of online form.
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Create an account to try it out</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        If you’re from a central government organisation you can create an account to try GOV.UK Forms out and start making forms.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Some departments are restricting who can create an account from their organisation. We’ll tell you if this affects you.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        You’ll need to use your government email address to create an account.
      </p>

      {{ govukButton({
        text: "Create an account",
        href: "your-groups",
        isStartButton: true
      }) }}

        Who can make forms live
      </h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        When you first create an account, you’ll be able to create and preview forms but you will not be able to make forms live.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        You’ll only be able to make forms live if:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>you’re from a central government organisation that publishes content on the GOV.UK website</li>
        <li>someone from your organisation has agreed to a ‘Memorandum of Understanding’ with GOV.UK Forms</li>
        <li>you’ve been given permission to make forms live from your organisation’s GOV.UK Forms admin</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        You’ll be able to get help with this process from your organisation’s GOV.UK Forms admin or from the GOV.UK Forms team.
